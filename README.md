# Note :

<big>[*] If You Can not get Your Expected Decrypted Data, There Can Be Three Possibilitys Why You Didn't Got Your Expected Data..</big>

[01] Maybe Your Massage Is Encrypted With 2 or 3 Step Decryptions. Though You Got An Output From Decryption But It Is Not Expected Decrypted Data, Try Decrypting It Again And Again..

[02] If You Don't Get Any Output Of Your Data, Instead Get a "No Encryption Found" Massage,  Try Decrypting Your String From [*] Custom Decrypt Option's Hash or Rot13 Sub-options. Because as I Said Earlier, Tool Can't Detect Hash and Rot13 Encryptions..

[03] Your Encrypted Massage's Encryption Method Is Not In The Tool's Database..
